This project primarily focuses on implementing fundamental data structures such as Linked Lists, Binary Search Trees, Doubly Skip Lists, and Quadruply Skip Lists. 
The aim is to investigate the behaviors of these data structures in real-world use cases.
All implementations utilize a similar main code that interacts with two CSV input files. 
operations.csv is used to determine which operations (ADD, UPDATE, DELETE) will be performed.
At the end of these operations, a file containing the updated data will be created.
I tested with different sized data files to get a better understaning of the behaviour of each operation.
